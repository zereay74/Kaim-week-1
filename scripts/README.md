# Scripts Overview  

1. **Modularization**:  
   - Defined scripts for `analysis`, `data_visualization`, `dataloader`, and `imports`, with their respective code logic to ensure modular design.  

2. **Notebook**:  
   - The `notebooks` folder contains **`week 1 task-1 notebook.ipynb`**, which illustrates the overall code flow.  
   - Functions from the `scripts` folder (`analysis.py`, `data_loader.py`, `imports.py`) are imported for modular implementation, reducing code redundancy and enhancing visualizations.  

3. **Quantitative Analysis**:  
   - The script `financial_analysis.py` implements quantitative analysis using **Pynance** and **TA-Lib**, also  correlation analysis is done.
